Gradle forces us to follow a certain project structure, by sticking to this convention it can easily find the files. JAR.
 In addition, we can specify their location of jar files in the "build.gradle" file in "dependencies", using
"implementation fileTree". Gradle retrieves these files from the repository specified in the same file in
 "repositories", generally this is the Maven repository.
